# Notes
For reader's information: This is a repository recording few of personal notes written by Zhi-Zhen Wang. Only the ones relevant to his application have been uploaded.

"An Introduction to Exceptional Field Theory" and "Half-Maximal Supergravity and AdS Vacua" are two recommended ones which shows how much basic knowledge Zhi-Zhen have obtained to match his research to the work of Emanuel Malek and Olaf Hohm. Because of the time limitation, the one "Half-Maximal Supergravity and AdS Vacua" can only be presented in its original un-formalized OneNote form, which could be a little messy. Zhi-Zhen apologize for the inconvenience it introduces.

The "main.pdf" is a to-be-completed version of Zhi-Zhen's master thesis. The one interests in his thesis research on de Sitter vacua may take a glimpse for this vert draft. For a detailed introduction of his master project and future research plan regarding that, an attached document named as "Research Statement" is recommended.

"Calabi--Yau Compactification" and "Supersymmetry and Superspace" are notes not so relevant to recent researches but strongly showed Zhi-Zhen's motivation and his solid background on supergravity and string compactification.

"An Introduction to p-adic AdS/CFT" is another research note originated by Zh-Zhen's personal interest. The one also attracts by this project is hihgly suggested to send a email to and communicate with Zhi-Zhen. His email address is zhizhen.wang@student.uva.nl.
